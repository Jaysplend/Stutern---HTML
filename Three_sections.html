       <h2><i>My Learning Experience</i></h2>
        
        <p>In the software development track of Stutern, So far, I have learnt about Git and Github,
             Basic Html, and CSS. It has really been a great experience and I look forward to being an expert in 
            web development after the training.  </p>
         <p>CSS is very important for styling web pages and making them look presentable. It is used for the aesthetics of web pages.</p>
